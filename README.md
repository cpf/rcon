Package `rcon` implements the communication protocol for communicating with RCON servers. Tested and working with Valve game servers.

## Installation

## Usage

A simple example using the library to authorize to the RCON server and issue a command.

```go
package main

import (
  "github.com/cpf/rcon"
)

func main() {
  client := rcon.NewClient("127.0.0.1" /* Your servers IP address */, 27015 /* Its port */)
  err := client.Connect()

  if nil != err {
    // Failed to open TCP connection to server.
    panic(err)
  }

  var packet *rcon.Packet

  packet, err = client.Authorize("password" /* The RCON password for your server */)

  if nil != err {
    // Failed to authorize your connection with the server.
    panic(err)
  }

  packet, err = client.Execute("command" /* The command to run */)

  if nil != err {
    // Failed to execute command
    panic(err)
  }

  // Result of running command stored in packet.Body

}
```
